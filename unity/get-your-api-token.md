# Get your API token

Navigate to your apps on the [justtrack dashboard](https://dashboard.justtrack.io/admin/apps) and view your app. If you haven't created your app on the dashboard yet, go to [Products](https://dashboard.justtrack.io/admin/products) and create the product for your app if needed, then go to [Apps](https://dashboard.justtrack.io/admin/apps) and create your app. This will generate the API token needed to use the justtrack SDK and it should look like this:

Thus, for this example app, you would be using `prod-c6654a0ae88b2f21111b9d69b4539fb1186de983f0ad826f0febaf28e3e3b7ed` as the API token.
