# Add the prefab

After finishing the installation of the justtrack SDK and its dependencies you should see a new menu called `justtrack`. Navigate to the first scene of your game and then select `Create SDK instance` from the `justtrack` menu.

Select the instance of the prefab and add your API tokens for Android and iOS as applicable. An API token looks like this:
